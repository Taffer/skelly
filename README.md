# Skelly

A small RPG set in the _Skeleton War_.

Have you ever wanted to:

* Battle f@ckboys in the [Skeleton War](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/skeleton-war).
* Fight sick-@ss demons in Hell.
* Attain **+1 Calcium** to resist damage.
* Rescue the skeletons trapped in living bodies.

You might be able to do it in this RPG, because I haven't finished writing the
story yet.

This whole thing was inspired by this image, which I think was done by
[Jim Holloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Holloway_(artist)):

![First of all, you're being a dick right now.](graphics/youre-being-a-dick.png)

The image has been popular on the Internet for quite a while; please let me
know the copyright status if you have some idea (or are Jim; dude, I loved
your work on the original _Paranoia_ books!).
